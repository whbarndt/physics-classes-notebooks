    "Your first lab exercise is designed to acquaint you with some of the features of Python you’ll be using during the semester, and also some of the programming principles you’ll be using long afterward. Pay particular attention to details of syntax; very slight changes in what you type can have a large impact on results. Pay attention to subtle meanings in how variables are treated by your mind and the interpreter of the programming language.\n",
