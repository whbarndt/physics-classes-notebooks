      <p><font size="+1"><font size="+2" face="Tahoma">The nuclear
            reactor personnel weren't able to continue the shutdown
            procedure until about 8 hours later. At this point they
            proceeded with the shutdown as usual but with a newly
            appointed night shift who had no news of this test. As they
            were bringing the power down to 700 MW, for non-concretely
            known reasons, the thermal power inside the reactor dropped
            to 30MW. Normal procedure at this point would be to either
            shutdown the reactor or slowly raise the thermal energy over
            the course of a day, however, the lead engineer said to
            proceed with the test. To do so, they started taking control
            rods out. They brought it up to 200 MW and decided to do the
            test. At this moment when the water pumps were taken
            offline, the reactor core's thermal energy instantly began
            to rise. In an attempt to stop the power surge they pressed
            a fail-safe button called AZ-5 which inserted every control
            rod back into the reactor core. However, unknowing to the
            personnel, these rods that had graphite near the ends
            enhanced the thermal energy at the bottom of the core to the
            point where the thermal power was greater than the design
            limit. Which then caused an initial explosion, from the
            built up steam, followed by a second explosion when the core
            ignites from the incoming oxygen.<br>
            <br>
            This was the tragedy of Chernobyl.</font></font></p>

          1986 in the north of the Ukranian SSR, Reactor 4 of the
          Chernobyl (or Chornobyl in Ukraine) Power Plant unexpectedly
          exploded. It is considered the worst nuclear disaster in
          history and the only event in history that resulted in
          fatalities having to do with commercial nuclear power. It is
          estimated to have killed at least 60 people but possibly more
          due to the radiation that escaped. <br>
          <br>
          On that day there was supposed to be a routine safety test for
          the reactor (how ironic). This test consisted of bringing down
          the thermal power inside the reactor core to 700M MW (Mega
          Watts) to simulate a power outage to check and see if the
          remaining rotational power from the turbines would keep water
          circulation running until the back up electrical generators
          could start. <br>
          <br>
          Normally the reactors thermal energy runs at about 3,200 MW.
          Earlier in the day they started the shutdown, slowly bringing
          down the energy. However, as that was happening the electrical
          dispatcher halted the shutdown, holding the&nbsp; thermal
          energy at about 1,600 MW. <br>
          <br>
          This is the start of what went wrong. <br>
