      <p><font size="+2" color="#00cccc">The problems all started when
          the reactor was stalled at 1600MW for 8 hours. This resulted
          in a build up of an isotope called Xenon-135. 95% of Xenon-135
          is created from Iodine-135 and Iodine-135 is a possible
          fission by-product. This is considered a very good neutron
          absorber (or poison to the nuclear engineer). Usually the
          temperature of the reactor is large enough to stop the
          production of this element but since it was running at such
          low power for so long, it began to build up. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="+2" color="#00cccc">Moments after the engineers
          began slowing the power down to 700MW, for non-concretely
          known reasons, the power suddenly dropped to 30 MW. This
          caused even more problems in the reactor since Xenon-135 was
          still being produced and the water was absorbing even more
          neutrons due to there being less steam. Even so, the lead
          engineer still wanted to do the test and told the engineers to
          pull out a majority of the control rods to get the reactor
          power back up. Nonetheless, by pulling out all but about 8
          rods that only brought the power up to about 200MW. Dispite
          regulations again, they proceeded with the test.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="+2" color="#c0c0c0"><font color="#00cccc">Just
            seconds after they shut down the water pumps, reactivity
            began to spike. This should be obvious, there was nothing
            controlling the rate of reaction, a majority of the control
            rods were pulled out, the Xenon-135 burned away quickly from
            the rise in power and, due to the positive void coefficient,
            the water became a worse neutron absorber by the second.
            Their only known solution was to shut down the reactor by
            inserting all of the control rods at once, which was their
            ultimately downfall.<br>
          </font></font></p>
      <p><font size="+2" color="#c0c0c0"><font color="#00cccc">The
            problem was with what really is happening when the control
            rods are pulled out. To better control the reactor, when the
            rods are pulled out, there is a graphite 'tip' that takes
            place of the boron carbide. It's a bit smaller than the
            boron and sits centered in the reactor core. By inserting
            the control rods, they effectively enhanced the reaction
            rate at the bottom of the reactor by displacing the water
            and replacing it with graphite. This then led to a severe
            spike in energy that, for reasons that are still up for
            debate, caused an explosion. The final reading at the plant
            was 33 GW but some models predict it may have gone as high
            as 330 GW.<font color="#c0c0c0"><br>
